# Data Analysis and Visualization

This repository contains Python scripts for performing data analysis and visualization on various datasets. Below are the descriptions of the analyses performed:

## 1. Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator

- This script calculates various statistical measures such as mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum of a given list of numbers.
- It reshapes the input list into a 3 by 3 matrix and calculates the statistics for rows, columns, and the flattened matrix.

## 2. Demographic Data Analyzer

- Analyzes demographic data from a dataset (`adult.data.csv`).
- Answers questions such as the number of people of each race, the average age of men, and the percentage of people with a Bachelor's degree.

## 3. Medical Data Visualizer

- Visualizes medical examination data from a dataset (`medical_examination.csv`).
- Creates categorical plots and explores relationships between features such as cholesterol level, glucose level, smoking status, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and overweight status.

## 4. Page View Time Series Visualizer

- Visualizes page view time series data from the freeCodeCamp forum (`fcc-forum-pageviews.csv`).
- Plots daily page views and creates bar plots to show the average page views by year and month.

## 5. Sea Level Predictor

- Analyzes sea level data (`epa-sea-level.csv`).
- Performs linear regression to predict future sea levels and visualizes the data and predictions.

Each script is well-documented with comments explaining each step of the analysis. The repository provides insights into different aspects of data analysis and visualization using Python and popular libraries such as NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
